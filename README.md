# RailModel

Discrete-event simulation of wagon operations on a rail network.  
Independent research project (2021) written in C++.  
The model explores how operational conditions, dispatching policies, and information completeness affect wagon turnaround and fleet utilization.

## Overview

**RailModel** simulates daily wagon circulation within a simplified railway network.  
It measures how network distances, travel times, empty-run routing, and control policies influence efficiency indicators such as:
- empty-run ratio,  
- wagon turnaround,  
- fleet utilization.

The model compares alternative operating regimes ‚Äî for example, unified vs. split fleets, and systems with or without redistribution.

## Methodology

The simulation combines deterministic and stochastic elements:

- **Shortest paths** between stations are precomputed by the **Dijkstra algorithm** (by distance and by time).  
- **Daily operations** follow a discrete cycle:
  1. cancel a share of unserved requests,  
  2. generate new requests with uneven intensity,  
  3. move wagons along active routes,  
  4. assign available wagons to open requests.  
- **Assignment problem** is solved using the **Hungarian algorithm** on a bipartite graph,  
  with weights defined by the selected control objective:  
  - *L* ‚Äî minimize empty-run kilometers,  
  - *T* ‚Äî minimize delivery time,  
  - *C* ‚Äî minimize empty-run cost,  
  - *P* ‚Äî maximize profit.

## Input Data

Input files in `.xlsx` format:

- `runtimes.xlsx` ‚Äî average travel times,  
- `emptycosts.xlsx` ‚Äî empty-run penalties.

## Visualization & Analysis

Network topology and routing paths were visualized using **Grin (Graph Interface)**.  
Statistical analysis and result plots were produced in **Python 3** with **NumPy** and **Matplotlib** libraries.  
Typical outputs include wagon turnaround distributions, empty-run ratios, and utilization trends under different scenarios.

## Key Findings

- Dispatching regimes **with redistribution** significantly reduce empty-run ratios compared to static allocation.  
- Differences between **unified and split fleets** are minor under otherwise identical settings.  
- Incomplete information (limited market visibility) decreases fleet efficiency.
